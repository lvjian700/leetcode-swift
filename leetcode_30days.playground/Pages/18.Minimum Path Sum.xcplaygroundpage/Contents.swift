 ## Minimum Path Sum
 <https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/530/week-3/3303/>
 
 Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

 > You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 
 ```
 Input:
 [
   [1,3,1],
   [1,5,1],
   [4,2,1]
 ]
 Output: 7
 Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
 ```
 */

let input = [
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]

class Solution {
    func minPathSum(_ grid: [[Int]]) -> Int {
      return 0
    }
}

Solution().minPathSum(input) // expected 7
