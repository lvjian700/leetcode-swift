 ## Search in Rotated Sorted Array
 <https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/530/week-3/3304/>
 
 Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

 (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

 You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

 You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

 Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

class Solution {
  func search(_ nums: [Int], _ target: Int) -> Int {
    return 0
  }
}

Solution().search([4,5,6,7,0,1,2], 0) // 4
Solution().search([4,5,6,7,0,1,2], 3) // -1
